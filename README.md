# Pathfinding Visualization Tool

My First Ever Python Project

## Features

- Visualize how Pathfinding works - step-by-step or finish the process in one click
- Uses Dijkstra's Algorithm
- Select what path this program should find - choose where the algorithm starts & stops and create obstacles (legend: blue => start node, violet => stop node, red => solid blocks)
